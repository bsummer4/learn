# Learn to Lens
This is a series of toy program that I wrote to teach myself to use
`Control.Lens`, and also my first real attempt at writing a solid tutorial
without using English. As a tutorial consumer, I often feel like I would be
better off just reading a series of progressively-more-difficult code snippets,
and looking things up in the reference material when I don't understand
something.
