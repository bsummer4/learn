<h4>This is a very long lab writeup.  Make sure you read the <i>whole thing</i>
before you start hacking.  You are only implementing two methods in this lab -- 
in particular, you don't have to print anything.  You just have to make it work

This is a lab that evaluates traffic in a city.  
Your job is to take information about roads and intersections
in a city, and derive shortest paths through the city.  Our cities have some regular
structure:

<UL>
<LI> The city has <b>streets</b> that travel East-West (roughly), and
<b>avenues</b> that travel North-South (roughly).
<LI> Streets and avenues are numbered consecutively upward, starting at
zero.  
<LI> By convention, streets will ascend from south to north, and avenues
will ascend from east to west (Think Manhattan).
<LI> Even-number streets are one-way, traveling in ascending order of avenue
(i.e. east to west).
<LI> Odd-number streets are one-way, traveling in descending order of avenue
(i.e. west to east).
<LI> Even-number avenues are one-way, traveling in ascending order of street
(i.e. south  to north).
<LI> Odd-number avenues are one-way, traveling in descending order of street
(i.e. north to south).
<LI> The only exceptions to above are:
<UL>
<LI> Avenues and streets whose numbers are multiples of 5 go in both directions.
<LI> The highest avenue always goes in both directions.
</UL>
<LI> There is an traffic light at every <b>intersection</b>.  Each light has the
     following properties:
<UL>
<LI> An x coordinate.
<LI> A y coordinate.
<LI> A duration that the light is green for the street.
<LI> A duration that the light is green for the avenue.
</UL>
<LI> Streets and avenues travel in straight lines between intersections.
<LI> The speed limit for the entire city is 30 MPH.
</UL>

We specify our city by simply listing the intersections.  Each intersection has six
values:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><b>Street Avenue X Y  Green-Street Green-Avenue</b></td></table></center><p>

<b>Street</b> and <b>Avenue</b> are integers.  The rest are doubles.  The units of <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are miles,
and the units of <b>Green-Street</b> and <b>Green-Avenue</b> are seconds.
<p>
Intersections may be specified in any order.
<p>
So, here are some example cities:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td>
<b><a href=city-1.txt>city-1.txt</a></b>
<hr>
<pre>
0 0  1.3 1  9 12
0 1  1.0 1  3 4
</pre>
</td><td>
<center>
<IMG src=city-1.jpg width=200><br>
</center>
</td></table></center><p>
Since light [0,0]'s coordinates are (1.3,1) and light [0,1]'s
coordinates are (1,1), the distance between the two lights 
is 0.3 miles.  Note that since 0 is a multiple of five, Street
zero and Avenue zero are two-way.  Moreover, since Avenue
one is the highest avenue, it is two-way.
<hr>

<center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td>
<b><a href=city-2.txt>city-2.txt</a></b>
<hr>
<pre>
1 0  1.3 1.4 9  12
1 1  1   1.4 11  7
2 0  1.3 1.8 9  12
1 2  0.7 1.4 3   3
0 1  1   1   3   3
2 1  1   2.2 15  7
2 2  0.7 2.2 6  15
0 2  0.7 1   3   3
0 0  1.3 1   9  12
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<center>
<IMG src=city-2.jpg width=300><br>
</center>
</td></table></center><p>

Now, Streets 1 and 2 are one-way, as is Avenue 1.  The distances between intersections
are straightforward, with the exception of [2,0] and [2,1].  That segment has a distance
of 0.5, since <i>sqrt(0.3<sup>2</sup>+0.4<sup>2</sup>)</i> equals five. 
<p>
Note also that the intersections are specified in a more random order here.

We are going to write a program that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the fastest path 
from light [0,0] to the light with the largest street and avenue.  We will always assume that
we travel each segment of road at exactly 30 MPH.  Moreover, we assume that we never wait
for light [0,0].  Our program is called 
<b>city_map</b> and is called as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top>
<tt>usage: city_map none|best|worst|avg time|print|jgraph - map on standard input</b>
</td></table></center><p>
<p>
In other words, there are two command line arguments.  The first has one of four values:
<p>
<uL>
<LI> <b>"none"</b> -- This simply reads in the graph.
<LI> <b>"best"</b> -- This will compute the fastest path through the graph assuming that 
      your traffic light is always green.
<LI> <b>"worst"</b> -- This will compute the fastest path through the graph assuming that 
      your traffic light always just turns red when you reach the light.  In other words,
      you wait the longest possible time at the light.
<LI> <b>"avg"</b> -- This is your average waiting time.  If the light is green for <i>G</i>
     seconds in your direction and <i>R</i> seconds in the other direction, then your 
     average waiting time is <i>0 * G/(R+G) + (R)/2 * R/(R+G)</i> = <i>R<sup>2</sup>/(2(R+G))</i> seconds.
</UL>
<p>
The second command line has one of three values:
<p>
<uL>
<LI> <b>"time"</b> -- This simply prints out the time of the fastest path.  If <b>none</b> was
specified, this prints zero.  
<LI> <b>"print"</b> -- This prints out all of the nodes of the graph, and then the path.
<LI> <b>"jgraph"</b> -- This creates a picture of the graph in jgraph.  Pipe the output through
<b>jgraph -P</b> to get a Postscript picture.
</UL>

Let's go through some examples.  First, as you can see, using <b>none</b> and <b>print</b>
just prints out the map, printing nodes and their edges (called "Road Segments").
Note how two-way roads have two segments for the same stretch of road.  Also note the
distances.  For example, the distance from [2,0] to [2,1] in <b>city-2.txt</b> is indeed 0.5 miles.
Note -- the intersections are printed in the order in which the nodes are specified in the
file.

Now, let's try some shortest path calculations:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>city_map best time < city-1.txt</b>
36
UNIX> <b>city_map worst time < city-1.txt</b>
40
UNIX> <b>city_map avg time < city-1.txt</b>
37.1429
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

The distance between the two lights in <b>city-1.txt</b> is 0.3 miles, which takes 36 seconds at 30 MPH:
0.3 / 30 * 3600 = 36.  Therefore the best time is 36 seconds.  The worst time adds four seconds because
in the worst case, you arrive at the light as it turns green for Avenue 1.  You wait four seconds before
the light turns green for you again.  The average case adds 1.1429 seconds to the best case.  This is 
because 3/7 of the time, the light is green.  The other 4/7 of the time, the light is red for an average
of 2 seconds.  Thus, your expected wait time is 0*(3/7) + 2*(4/7) = 8/7 = 1.1429 seconds.  Note,
that is also equal to the equation I gave: <i>4<sup>2</sup>/(2(3+4))</i> = 8/7.
<p>
We print the paths below:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>city_map best print < city-1.txt</b>
      0 : Intersection:    0    0 -     1.300000     1.000000 -     9.000000    12.000000

      3 :    Segment to    0    0       Distance     0.300000
      4 : PATH: [0000,0000] -> [0000,0001] - Time:    36.000000

</pre>

Let's look at the paths in 
<b><a href=city-2.txt>city-2.txt</a></b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>city_map best print < city-2.txt | grep PATH</b>
     18 : PATH: [0000,0000] -> [0001,0000] - Time:    48.000000
     19 : PATH: [0001,0000] -> [0002,0000] - Time:    96.000000
     20 : PATH: [0002,0000] -> [0002,0001] - Time:   156.000000
     21 : PATH: [0002,0001] -> [0002,0002] - Time:   192.000000

</pre>

Obviously, when all lights are green, the fastest path is the one going
from light [2,0] to [2,1], since that cuts distance.  That path goes
(0.4 + 0.4 + 0.5 + 0.3) = 1.6 miles (192 seconds at 30MPH), while the
path that travels along Street 0 to Avenue 2 goes (0.3 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.8) = 
1.8 miles (216 seconds).
<p>
When we wait the maximum time, we wait (9+9+7+15) = 40 seconds for lights,
for a total of 232 seconds on the first path.  On the second, we wait
(3+3+3+6) = 15 seconds, for a total of 231.  For that reason, the worst
case path is the one that travels all the way down Street 0 first.
The best average case uses the first path.

<p>
Finally, let's look at <b><a href=city-3.txt>city-3.txt</a></b>.  Clearly,
the best case path simply has the shortest number of edges, since all
road segments are the same length:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>city_map best print < city-3.txt | grep PATH</b>
     30 : PATH: [0000,0000] -> [0001,0000] - Time:    12.000000
     31 : PATH: [0001,0000] -> [0002,0000] - Time:    24.000000
     32 : PATH: [0002,0000] -> [0002,0001] - Time:    36.000000
     33 : PATH: [0002,0001] -> [0002,0002] - Time:    48.000000
     34 : PATH: [0002,0002] -> [0002,0003] - Time:    60.000000
     35 : PATH: [0002,0003] -> [0002,0004] - Time:    72.000000
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

However, when we wait the maximum amount for each light, we see
that we can get through the graph in a circuitous fashion, waiting
a maximum of one second for each light.  Even though this makes
us travel 1.4 miles (168 seconds) instead of 0.6 (72 seconds), 
it is worth it because we
only wait 14 extra seconds for lights.  The original path 
makes us wait 115 seconds for a total of 187 seconds, making it
inferior to the path below:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>city_map worst print < city-3.txt | grep PATH</b>
     30 : PATH: [0000,0000] -> [0001,0000] - Time:    13.000000
     31 : PATH: [0001,0000] -> [0002,0000] - Time:    26.000000
     32 : PATH: [0002,0000] -> [0002,0001] - Time:    39.000000

The <b>jgraph</b> output is nice if you can plot postscript.  Below, I've
converted the outputs to JPG files.  For example:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>city_map none jgraph < city-2.txt | jgraph -P > city-2-none.ps</b>
UNIX> <b>open city-2-none.ps</b>
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Then I convert the postscript to JPG using the <b>Preview</b> program on my 
Macintosh.

<h1>The Code, and Your Job</h1>

I have provided two program files for you.  You are <i>not</i> allowed to modify either
of these:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> A header file <b><a href=city_map.h>city_map.h</a></b>.  This defines three
classes that are at the heart of this assigment.  They are the <b>Intersection</b>,
<b>Road_Segment</b> and <b>City_Map</b>.  More on them later.
<p>
<LI> An object file <b>city_map_base.o</b>.  This implements the <b>main()</b> routine
of <b>city_map</b>, plus the methods <b>City_Map::Print()</b> and <b>City_Map::Spit_Jgraph()</b>.
This is nice because you don't have to parse command line arguments or print anything.
</UL>

Your job is to write <b>city_map.cpp</b>, which will implement two methods:

<UL>
<LI> <b>City_Map::City_Map()</b>: The constructor needs to create a <b>City_Map</b> from
a city file on standard input.  You may assume that there are no errors in <b>City_Map</b>.
<p>
<LI> <b>City_Map::Dijkstra(int avg_best_worst)</b>: This implements Dijkstra's shortest
path algorithm from node <b>first</b> to node <b>last</b>.  You may assume that you can 
always reach <b>last</b> from <b>first</b>.  The argument <b>avg_best_worst</b> is 'A', 
'B', or 'W', depending on which of those three ways you want to calculate the shortest
path.  <b>Dijkstra()</b> should return the distance of the shortest path.  Additionally,
it should put that path in <b>path</b>, which will go from <b>first</b> to <b>last</b>,
</UL>

When you are done, you should be able to compile with:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>g++ -o city_map -I/home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab8 city_map.cpp /home/plank/cs302/Labs/Lab8/city_map_base.o</b>
</pre>

To grade, I am going to pipe the output of your <b>city_map</b> with <b>print</b> to <b>sort</b>.
It must match the output of my <b>city_map</b> piped to <b>sort</b>.  All of the grading examples
have unique light durations and edge lengths.  Therefore, it should not be hard to make the two
outputs match when piped to <b>sort</b>.  Note that in <b>city-3.txt</b>, there are multiple <b>best</b>
and <b>avg</b> paths -- that is because light durations and edge lengths are not unique.  You do <i>not</i>
have to match my output in this case -- you only have to match the outputs (after piping to <b>sort</b>)
of the grading examples.

<hr>
<h3>Detail on the header file</h3>

Here is <b><a href=city_map.h>city_map.h</a></b>, in three parts:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef enum { STREET, AVENUE } Road_Type;

class Intersection {
  public:
    int street;
    int avenue;
    double x;
    double y;
    double green[2];    // Light green times for STREET & AVENUE
    list &lt;class Road_Segment *&gt; adj;
    double best_time;
    class Road_Segment *backedge;
    multimap &lt;double, Intersection *&gt;::iterator bfsq_ptr;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The first five fields of an <b>Intersection</b> are the input values -- street number,
avenue number, x coordinate, y coordinate, and green durations, indexed by <b>Road_Type</b>.
Next is an adjacency list.  For example, in 
<b><a href=city-2.txt>city-2.txt</a></b>, the adjacency list for [1,1] contains road
segments to [1,0] and [0,1].  This is because street 1 and avenue 1 are both one-way.
On the other hand, the adjacency list for [1,2] contains road segments to [0,2], [1,2]
and [1,1].  
<p>
<i>I don't care about the order of your adjacency lists.  They do not have to match 
mine.  This is why I pipe the output of <b>city_map</b> to <b>sort</b></i> .
<p>
The <b>best_time</b>, <b>backedge</b> and <b>bfsq_ptr</b> 
fields are for you to use when you implement <b>Dijkstra</b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Road_Segment {
   public:
     Road_Type type;
     int number;
     double distance;
     Intersection *from;
     Intersection *to;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Road_Segment</b> instances represent edges.  They should be completely straightforward.
For example, in 
<b><a href=city-2.txt>city-2.txt</a></b> the <b>Road_Segment</b> values for the segment
from [2,0] to [2,1] will have:
<UL>
<LI> <b>type</b> = <b>STREET</b>.
<LI> <b>number</b> = 2. (Since the segment is part of Street 2).
<LI> <b>distance</b> = 0.5.
<LI> <b>from</b> is a pointer to light [2,0].
<LI> <b>to</b> is a pointer to light [2,1].
</UL>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class City_Map {
  public:
    City_Map();  
    void Print();
    void Spit_Jgraph();
    double Dijkstra(int avg_best_worst);   // 'A' for avg, 'B' for best, 'W' for worst
    Intersection *first;
    Intersection *last;
    list &lt;Intersection *&gt; all;
    multimap &lt;double, Intersection *&gt; bfsq;
    list &lt;Road_Segment *&gt; path;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Finally, the <b>City_Map</b> class has four methods -- the constructor and <b>Dijkstra()</b>, 
which you implement, and <b>Print()/Spit_Jgraph()</b>, which I have implemented.
<p>
Additionally, it has five variables.  The first three you have to set up with your
constructor:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>first</b> is a pointer to light [0,0].
<LI> <b>last</b> is a pointer to the light of the largest street and avenue.
<LI> <b>all</b> is list of lights, <i>in the order in which they appear in the input file</i>.
<LI> <b>bfsq</b> is is for you to use when you implement <b>Dijkstra()</b>.   
<LI> <b>path</b> should be set by <b>Dijstra()</b> to be the shortest path from <b>first</b> to <b>last</b>.
</UL>

<hr>
<h2>Help Getting Started</h2>

Start off by implementing <b>Dijkstra()</b> to do nothing by return 0.  That lets you work on 
the constructor.
<p>
Work incrementally on the constructor.  First, write a pass that reads all of the lights,
creates their <b>Intersection</b> classes and puts them onto <b>all</b>, without worrying
about adjacency lists.  You should then be able to run the program and have it print out
the graph without edges.  
<p>
Next, work on adding the edges and again print.   This is a pain.  I used a temporary two-dimensional
vector of Intersections, which made it easy for me to get from one intersection to another, and 
set up the adjacencly lists.  When I was done, I discarded the vector (actually, that was done 
automatically for me)..
<p>
When you're done with this, <b>none</b> and
<b>print</b> should work.  Then get busy on <b>Dijkstra()</b>.  Frankly, I think writing <b>Dijkstra()</b>
is easier than getting the adjacency lists set up.
