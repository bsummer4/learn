# Haskell Tutorial

This is a weird little Haskell tutorial build as a set of shell scripts
that build, explain, and execute a series of increasingly-complex Haskell
programs. The idea is to throw people into runnable code examples with as
little effort as possible.

To keep explainations as light as possible, we assume that the reader is an
experienced programmer that has access to a machine with OSX and homebrew.

To begin, read each shell script, execute it, try to understand what everything
is doing, and then fuck around with the scripts in your editor to get a feel
for things.
