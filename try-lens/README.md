# Learn to Lens

This is a series of toy program that I wrote to teach myself to use
`Control.Lens`, and also my first real attempt at writing a solid tutorial
without using any English. As a tutorial consumer, I often feel like I
would be better off just reading a series of progressively-more-difficult
code snippets, and looking things up in the reference material when I don't
understand something.
